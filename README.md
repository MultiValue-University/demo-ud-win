# xdemo-ud-win

The XDEMO account from UD 8.2.1 Windows

XDEMO is the baseline Server account that should be used for future samples and examples within the MVUniversity. This particular repository is utilized when using UniData on Windows.

In your command line

```
git clone https://github.com/MultiValue-University/xdemo-ud-win.git XDEMO
```

The command above will take the entire external xdemo-ud-win repository and create a local version on your machine. By adding  XDEMO to the end of the git clone command, as above, you ensure that the created directory will be named XDEMO; otherwise the directory will be named after the repository (xdemo-ud-win).   

**If you are a UniData Windows user - this is the repository you should clone to access a baseline Server Account.**
